exportedVolumeIsMissingWwn=Unmanaged volume {0} is exported, but its WWN could not be located, so it can't be ingested.
vplexBackendVolumeHasNoParent=A virtual volume for VPLEX backend volume {0} could not be found. Possibly the VPLEX device has not been discovered for Unmanaged Volumes since the backend array was discovered.
unManagedProtectionSetNotFound=No unmanaged protection set could be found for requested volume: {0}.  Please run unmanaged CG discovery of registered protection systems and re-attempt operation.
